# Notifications Database Schema (MVP)

This document defines the database schema required to support user notifications in TaskTeam.

## notification Table

Stores notifications delivered to users for important events.

| Column Name        | Type      | Constraints                   | Description                     |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| id                 | UUID      | PK                            | Unique notification identifier  |
| user_id            | UUID      | FK → user.id                  | Recipient user                  |
| project_id         | UUID      | FK → project.id, NULLABLE     | Related project (if applicable) |
| type               | VARCHAR   | NOT NULL                      | Notification type               |
| is_read            | BOOLEAN   | DEFAULT false                 | Read status                     |

## Relationships

* A **user** can have many notifications → `notification.user_id`.
* A **notification** may optionally reference a project → `notification.project_id`.

## Constraints & Rules

* Each notification must belong to a user.
* Notifications are unread by default.
* Users may mark notifications as read but not delete system records.

## Design Notes

* Notifications are generated by system events.
* `type` allows flexible notification categorization (task assigned, mention, etc.).
* Read tracking enables badge counts and alerts.
* Notification cleanup policies may be added later.
